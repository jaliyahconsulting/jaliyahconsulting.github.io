                            The Jali, pl. Jalolu, in French called Griot, is a member of the professional musician's caste of the Manding society a large group of peoples in West Africa (Guniea, Guniea Bissau, Mali, Senegal and the Gambia).
                            Many West African societies know this "singer" profession that may be compared with the Troubadours in European middle age.
                        </blockquote>
                        <p>
                            This profession is hereditary, in the great family clan Kouyate, Diabate (Jobateh), Konte (Kanute), Cissokho (Suso) and others.
                            For centuries they have been court musicians, advisors and diplomats in the service of wealthy personalities, political and religious leaders.
                            His art is the Jaliya ("what the Jali does") - instrumental as musician and vocal as praise singer, historian, geneologist, story teller, entertainer and more generally, jalis are carries of the oral tradition.
                            The men sing and play instruments Kora, Balfon and Konting, the women are singers and play the Newo, a metal percussion instrument.
                            Jaliya is a very complex connection of musical and verbal art forms, emebedded in the social context of the Manding cultures.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            At social (marriage) and religious, also private occasions they are invited to praise the patrons with msucial virtuosity and mastery of the words and to remind the glorious and heroic past of their families.
                            They should not be missing at any important event and they are also sought after as advisors and mediators.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The education of the musicians starts already at an age of 5 years, they are taught by father, uncle, elder brother or by another Jali family.
                            When they are grown up they are mastering the instrumental techiques and the complicated repertoire of songs and instrumental accomplishments, praise names of all the family clans, historial facts, myths and proverbs of the Jaliya, much of that is improvised during the preformance.
                            The classical repetoire is very rich, some of the songs date back to the time of Sundiatam the great mythical king of the Mali empire in the 13th century.

                        <h2>Wendi O'Neal</h2>
                        <p>
                            As a cultural worker, activist, facilitator, and educator, Wendi O'Neal works to connect social and economic justice groups' mission, vision and values with how everyday work gets done.
                            She uses spiritually grounded practices, visual art, story circles and song sharing as tools for growing inspiration and building democratic process.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Born and raised in New Orleans, she has worked in local, regional and national organizations; but her heart's work is rooted in the Deep South of the US, especially the kind of organizing that happens around kitchen tables and good food.
                            She is a dacner, "makers & scrap paper" visual artist, freedom-song-singer and teacher.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            One of her favorite teachers is her father, John O'Neal, co-founder of the Free Southern Theater, a Radical Black Theater project that grew out of the Studen Non-Violent Coordinating Committee in the 1960's.
                            In 1991, she helped found one of the first documented out lesbian and bisexual womens's alliances at a Historically Black College, Spelman, in Atlanta, GA - which continues to exist as the group, Afrekete today.
